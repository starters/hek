## Install

```bash
$ npm install -g kik
```

## Usage

Kik is a command-line tool and a library for creating projects by using starters.
It'll save your time from initializing projects from scratch, letting you choose
what kind of project that you'd like to choose. It's designed not only for JavaScript,
you can use it for creating any project by choosing or creating a starter.

## Command-line

After installing it, you can simply call it on command-line to start your next project:

```bash
$ kik
```

It'll prompt you some basic questions like your Github handle, where you keep your code for once,
and some project specific questions like its name, Github URL etc.

## Programmatical Interface

See `examples/programmatical.js` for how to use kik programmatically.
